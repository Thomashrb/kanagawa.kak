# kanagawa.kak

Color scheme for [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) forked from [https://github.com/anhsirk0/kakoune-themes]
Attempts to fix some minor issues I was having where errors and trailing whitespace was not highlighted like
I wanted it to be.

## Installation

Download color scheme:

```bash
$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomashrb/kanagawa.kak/master/kanagawa.kak -o ~/.config/kak/colors/kanagawa.kak --create-dirs
```

Add to your `kakrc` file:

```kakoune
colorscheme kanagawa
```
